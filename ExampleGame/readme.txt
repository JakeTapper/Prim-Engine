Controls:
(All movement is based on camera direction)
W/S - Forward and backward movement
A/D - Strafing movement
Spacebar - Jump
F1 - Reset player 
Mouse - Rotate camera

Known bugs with the example game itself:
 - Sometimes the player won't be controllable as soon as the game starts. Just press F1 to reset it and it should work fine
 - The game starts as a black screen. This happened to me because of an error with either githubs download or unzipping the files, but the shaders lost their formatting. Replace them with the raw text from github and it should work fine
